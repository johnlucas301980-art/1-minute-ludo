-   [x] POST /api/auth/refresh — issues new access token
-   [x] POST /api/auth/logout — single device or all devices
-   [x] authenticate middleware — protects future routes via Bearer token
-   [x] Flutter: TokenStorage (flutter_secure_storage — Android Keystore / iOS Keychain)

## Phase 2.5.1 - Password Reset (Backend + Flutter Service Layer)

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-17)

-   [x] Migration 0003: password_reset_otps table (id, user_id FK, otp_hash, expires_at, attempts, used_at, created_at)
-   [x] OTP library: cryptographically random 6-digit OTP, SHA-256 hash, constant-time comparison (timingSafeEqual)
-   [x] Email library: Nodemailer, provider-agnostic (any SMTP); server starts and warns if unconfigured
-   [x] JWT_PASSWORD_RESET_SECRET: separate secret, separate sign/verify functions, prevents token type confusion
-   [x] POST /api/auth/password-reset/request — rate-limited (max 3/hour), account enumeration-safe response
-   [x] POST /api/auth/password-reset/verify — atomic attempt tracking (UPDATE…RETURNING), max 5 attempts
-   [x] POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm — validates reset JWT + OTP session, updates password, revokes all refresh tokens atomically
-   [x] Hourly cleanup interval for expired OTP rows (.unref() for clean process exit)
-   [x] Flutter: PasswordResetService — requestOtp, verifyOtp, confirmReset; OtpExpiredException subclass
-   [x] End-to-end verified on Replit: request → verify → confirm → new-password login → old refresh token rejected → reset token replay rejected → rate limit enforced

## Phase 2.6 - Flutter Auth UI Screens

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] `AuthTextField` (`mobile/lib/features/auth/widgets/auth_text_field.dart`) — shared reusable styled `TextFormField`; dark surface fill, focus/error borders, optional visibility toggle suffix icon; used by both auth screens
-   [x] `LoginScreen` (`mobile/lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart`) — branding area (gold icon, title, subtitle); form card with Identifier and Password fields; inline validation messages; error banner for `ApiException` / `AccountForbiddenException`; loading spinner on submit; `onLoginSuccess(UserProfile)` and `onRegisterPressed` callbacks; no `Navigator` calls
-   [x] `RegisterScreen` (`mobile/lib/features/auth/screens/register_screen.dart`) — AppBar "Create Account"; Full Name, Email (optional), Mobile (optional), Password fields; inline validation messages; error banner for `ApiException` (400, 409); loading spinner on submit; `onRegisterSuccess(UserProfile)` and `onLoginPressed` callbacks; no `Navigator` calls
-   [x] Constructor DI only — `AuthService` injected into both screens; no singletons
-   [x] Material 3 dark/gold design — palette identical to `ProfileScreen` and `WalletScreen`
-   [x] No backend changes; no database migrations; no navigation shell; no home lobby; no Google Sign-In; no password reset UI
-   [x] 27 new widget tests (12 `LoginScreen` + 15 `RegisterScreen`): smoke, field presence, validation messages, server error banners, loading state, callbacks, password visibility toggle, optional-field handling
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 164/164 passed (137 prior + 27 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 3 - Flutter Navigation Shell

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] `HomeScreen` (`mobile/lib/features/home/screens/home_screen.dart`) — placeholder home screen (game controller icon, title, "Game lobby coming soon" tagline); no service dependencies; stateless
-   [x] `MainShell` (`mobile/lib/navigation/main_shell.dart`) — `BottomNavigationBar` with three tabs: Home (index 0), Profile (index 1), Wallet (index 2); `IndexedStack` preserves each screen's state across switches; AppBar title tracks active tab; logout `IconButton` fires `onLogout` callback; no `Navigator` calls
-   [x] `AuthGate` (`mobile/lib/navigation/auth_gate.dart`) — entry point widget; calls `AuthService.isLoggedIn()` on mount; routes to `LoginScreen` / `RegisterScreen` (unauthenticated) or `MainShell` (authenticated); manages Login ↔ Register swap internally via state; shows loading spinner during initial session check and logout; calls `AuthService.logout()` and returns to `LoginScreen` on logout
-   [x] `main.dart` updated — all services constructed with constructor DI (`TokenStorage` → `ApiClient` → services); `OneLudoApp` accepts services as required parameters; `AuthGate` is the root `home`; `_PlaceholderHome` removed
-   [x] Constructor DI only throughout — no singletons, no static references
-   [x] Material 3 dark/gold palette consistent with all existing screens
-   [x] No backend changes; no new packages; all existing screens and services preserved
-   [x] 24 new widget tests (4 `HomeScreen` + 10 `MainShell` + 9 `AuthGate` + 1 `widget_test` update): smoke, icon/text presence, tab switching, AppBar title changes, logout callback, session check → LoginScreen/MainShell routing, register/login link navigation, login/register success → MainShell, logout → LoginScreen
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 188/188 passed (164 prior + 24 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 3.1 - Player Profile Foundation

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-17)

-   [x] GET /api/profile — returns authenticated player's profile (no password_hash, no google_id)
-   [x] PUT /api/profile — updates mutable fields: full_name, country, avatar (URL or null)
-   [x] authenticate middleware applied to both endpoints
-   [x] Input validation: empty body → 400, full_name length (2–120), country length (≤100), avatar must be http/https URL or null
-   [x] Dynamic SET clause — only provided fields are updated; updated_at maintained by DB trigger
-   [x] 35/35 API tests pass (backend/tests/phase31_profile.sh)
-   [x] No new migration required — users table already contains all required columns

## Phase 3.2 - Flutter Profile Service Layer

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-17)

-   [x] UserProfile model extended with optional updatedAt field (updated_at from GET /profile and PUT /profile responses)
-   [x] ProfileService — getProfile() → GET /api/profile → UserProfile
-   [x] ProfileService — updateProfile() → PUT /api/profile (partial update; null clears nullable fields; ArgumentError if no fields given)
-   [x] Constructor-injected ApiClient — no singletons; same pattern as AuthService
-   [x] Automatic token refresh handled by ApiClient (transparent to ProfileService)
-   [x] 15 unit tests written (mobile/test/features/profile/profile_service_test.dart) covering happy paths, error states, token refresh, and network timeout
-   [x] No backend changes — Phase 3.1 backend untouched
-   [x] No new migration required

## Phase 3.3 - Change Password Endpoint

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-17)

-   [x] PUT /api/profile/password — authenticated endpoint to change the current player's password
-   [x] Verifies current password via bcrypt.compare before accepting any change
-   [x] New password hashed with bcrypt cost factor 12 (consistent with registration)
-   [x] Validates: current_password required; new_password required, ≥8 chars, ≥1 letter, ≥1 digit, must differ from current
-   [x] Revokes all refresh tokens after successful change (deleteRefreshTokensByUser) — same security posture as password reset
-   [x] authenticate middleware applied — Bearer token required
-   [x] updatePasswordById() added to user.service.ts
-   [x] No new database migration required — password_hash column already exists
-   [x] 25/25 integration tests pass (backend/tests/phase33_change_password.sh)
-   [x] No Flutter changes — Phase 3.4 (ChangePasswordService) is the Flutter layer

## Phase 3.4 - Flutter Change Password Service Layer

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] WrongCurrentPasswordException added to core/errors/api_exception.dart — typed exception for wrong-password 401 that does NOT clear the player's tokens or end the session
-   [x] ApiClient.authenticatedRequest extended with optional domainRejectionPattern parameter — peeks at the 401 response body and surfaces domain-level rejections directly without attempting a refresh; fully backward-compatible (all existing callers unchanged)
-   [x] ChangePasswordService — changePassword(currentPassword, newPassword) → Future<void>; wraps PUT /api/profile/password via authenticatedRequest; maps "Current password is incorrect" 401 to WrongCurrentPasswordException
-   [x] Constructor-injected ApiClient — no singletons; same pattern as ProfileService and PasswordResetService
-   [x] No client-side field validation — backend is the single source of truth; 400 errors surface as ApiException(400)
-   [x] No new backend changes — Phase 3.3 endpoint reused as-is
-   [x] No new database migration required
-   [x] 11/11 unit tests pass (mobile/test/features/profile/change_password_service_test.dart)
-   [x] 49/49 total Flutter tests pass — no regressions in ApiClient, TokenStorage, AuthService, ProfileService, or widget tests
-   [x] flutter analyze clean — no issues

## Phase 4.6 - Flutter Payment UI

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] `DepositSheet` (`mobile/lib/features/wallet/widgets/deposit_sheet.dart`) — modal bottom sheet; Material 3 dark/gold design matching ProfileScreen and WalletScreen; amount field (validated: required, numeric, > 0, ≤ 1 000 000); optional reference field; loading spinner on submit; error banner for ApiException and SessionExpiredException; calls `onSuccess(PaymentResult)` then dismisses on server confirmation
-   [x] `WithdrawSheet` (`mobile/lib/features/wallet/widgets/withdraw_sheet.dart`) — same structure as DepositSheet; shows current balance chip for UX context; catches `InsufficientBalanceException` and shows inline error banner without clearing the session — player can adjust amount and retry; reference field optional
-   [x] `WalletScreen` updated — added `paymentService` constructor parameter (required, injected); Deposit (green) and Withdraw (red outlined) action buttons placed between balance card and transaction history; tapping either opens the corresponding sheet via `showModalBottomSheet`; `onSuccess` calls `_loadData()` to refresh the full wallet state from the server
-   [x] No new services, no singletons, no backend changes
-   [x] No new dependencies added
-   [x] 25 new tests:
    -   `payment_sheet_test.dart` (21): DepositSheet smoke, fields present, empty/invalid/zero amount validation, success (onSuccess called), amount+reference forwarded, blank reference → null, ApiException banner, SessionExpiredException banner; WithdrawSheet smoke, balance chip shown, fractional balance formatting, empty/zero amount validation, success, InsufficientBalanceException inline banner (session intact), ApiException banner, SessionExpiredException banner, amount+reference forwarded, blank reference → null
    -   `wallet_screen_test.dart` (4 added): Deposit button visible after load, Withdraw button visible after load, tapping Deposit opens DepositSheet, tapping Withdraw opens WithdrawSheet
-   [x] Existing test 7 in `wallet_screen_test.dart` updated — "Deposit" text now matches both the action button and the transaction tile type label (`findsWidgets`)
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 137/137 passed (112 prior + 25 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 4.5 - Flutter Payment Service Layer

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] `InsufficientBalanceException` added to `core/errors/api_exception.dart` — typed exception for HTTP 422 (insufficient balance); extends `ApiException`; tokens NOT cleared; session remains active
-   [x] `PaymentResult` model (`mobile/lib/features/wallet/models/payment_result.dart`) — immutable; wraps `Wallet` + `WalletTransaction`; `fromJson` delegates to existing model factories
-   [x] `PaymentService` (`mobile/lib/features/wallet/services/payment_service.dart`) — constructor-injected `ApiClient`; no singletons:
    -   `deposit({required double amount, String? reference})` → `Future<PaymentResult>`; POSTs to `/wallet/deposit`; reference key omitted from body when not provided
    -   `withdraw({required double amount, String? reference})` → `Future<PaymentResult>`; POSTs to `/wallet/withdraw`; maps 422 `ApiException` to `InsufficientBalanceException`
-   [x] No client-side amount validation — backend is the single source of truth; 400 errors surface as `ApiException(400)`
-   [x] Error propagation identical to `WalletService` and `ProfileService`: `ApiException`, `SessionExpiredException`, network exceptions all propagate unchanged (except 422 → `InsufficientBalanceException`)
-   [x] No new backend changes — Phase 4.4 endpoints consumed as-is
-   [x] No new dependencies added
-   [x] No new database migration required
-   [x] 22 new unit tests (`mobile/test/features/wallet/payment_service_test.dart`): deposit happy-path (wallet fields, transaction fields, body shape, reference sent/omitted, token refresh + retry, 401 session expiry, 500, network failure, no token), withdraw happy-path (all fields, body shape, reference omitted), insufficient balance (InsufficientBalanceException, is ApiException subclass, carries server message), withdraw session/network errors (token refresh, 401, 500, network), PaymentResult.fromJson (field types, int-to-double coercion)
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 112/112 passed (90 prior + 22 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 4.4 - Backend Payment Foundation

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] `depositPoints(userId, amount, reference?)` — Atomic Postgres transaction: upsert wallet → insert pending transaction → credit balance → mark completed; uses a dedicated `pg.PoolClient` so the entire flow is wrapped in a single `BEGIN/COMMIT`
-   [x] `withdrawPoints(userId, amount, reference?)` — Same pattern with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` row-lock, pre-flight balance check, and `InsufficientBalanceError` domain error; DB `CHECK (points >= 0)` is a final safety net
-   [x] `POST /api/wallet/deposit` — validates amount (positive, finite, ≤ 1 000 000, rounded to 2 d.p.) and optional reference (≤ 255 chars); returns updated wallet + completed transaction
-   [x] `POST /api/wallet/withdraw` — same validation; returns 422 `Insufficient balance.` on `InsufficientBalanceError`
-   [x] Both routes protected by `authenticate` middleware (401 on missing/invalid token)
-   [x] No payment gateway dependency — implementation is provider-agnostic
-   [x] 50 new integration tests in `backend/tests/phase44_wallet_payment.sh`: auth protection (4), input validation (9), deposit happy-path (13), withdraw happy-path (9), insufficient balance (3), balance consistency cross-check (6), transaction history (4), decimal amounts (2)
-   [x] All 50/50 Phase 4.4 tests passed
-   [x] All prior backend integration tests confirmed: Phase 3.3 (25/25), Phase 3.6 (21/21), Phase 4.1 (31/31) — zero regressions
-   [x] Backend build: clean (`esbuild` bundle, no TypeScript errors)
-   [x] Docs updated: 06_API.md, 02_PROJECT_STATUS.md, 09_CHANGELOG.md

## Phase 4.3 - Flutter Wallet Screen UI

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] WalletScreen — StatefulWidget with constructor-injected WalletService; no singletons

-   [x] AnimatedSwitcher transitions between states (280 ms, matching ProfileScreen)
-   [x] RefreshIndicator (pull-to-refresh) reloads wallet and history in parallel via Future.wait
-   [x] _BalanceCard — gold-bordered gradient card showing points (large), TOTAL DEPOSITED (green), TOTAL WITHDRAWN (red)

-   [x] Transaction type labels: Deposit / Withdrawal / Reward / Entry Fee / Refund
-   [x] Transaction status pills: Completed (green) / Pending (amber) / Failed (red) / Reversed (grey)
-   [x] _EmptyHistoryView — icon + message when no transactions exist
-   [x] No new dependencies added; no backend changes; no new database migration
-   [x] 10 widget tests (mobile/test/features/wallet/wallet_screen_test.dart) using fake WalletService subclasses — no platform-channel dependencies
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 90/90 passed (80 prior + 10 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 4.2 - Flutter Wallet Service

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] Wallet model — immutable, `fromJson`, `num` → `double` coercion for all numeric fields
-   [x] WalletTransaction model — immutable, `fromJson`, nullable `reference`, `num` → `double` coercion
-   [x] WalletHistory model — in `wallet.dart`; wraps `transactions` + `pagination` envelope from GET /api/wallet/history; `total` maps to `pagination.count`
-   [x] WalletService — constructor-injected `ApiClient`, no singletons; `getWallet()`, `getHistory({limit, offset})`; query params appended to path string
-   [x] Error propagation identical to ProfileService: `ApiException`, `SessionExpiredException`, raw network exceptions all propagate unchanged
-   [x] No new dependencies added
-   [x] 21 new unit tests — covers success, 401 (expiry + refresh/retry), 500, malformed response, network failure, pagination param verification via request capture, default param verification
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues
-   [x] flutter test — 80/80 passed (59 prior + 21 new, zero regressions)

## Phase 4.1 - Wallet Backend Foundation

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] Migration 0004: wallets table (id, user_id FK UNIQUE, points, total_deposit, total_withdraw, updated_at; CHECK points >= 0; auto updated_at trigger)
-   [x] Migration 0005: transactions table (id, user_id FK, type CHECK IN deposit/withdraw/reward/entry_fee/refund, amount, status CHECK IN pending/completed/failed/reversed, reference, created_at; compound index on user_id + created_at DESC)
-   [x] Migration 0006: backfill wallets for all existing users (INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)
-   [x] wallet.service.ts — findWalletByUserId(), findOrCreateWallet() (atomic upsert), getTransactions() (paginated, newest first)
-   [x] wallet.controller.ts — getWallet() auto-creates wallet on first access; getWalletHistory() with limit (1–100, default 20) and offset (≥0, default 0) clamping
-   [x] routes/wallet.ts — GET /wallet and GET /wallet/history, both behind authenticate middleware
-   [x] routes/index.ts — walletRouter mounted
-   [x] No balance modification logic, no deposit/withdraw endpoints, no payment gateway, no Socket.IO events
-   [x] 31/31 integration tests pass (backend/tests/phase41_wallet.sh)
-   [x] All prior backend tests still pass: 35/35 (phase31) + 25/25 (phase33) + 21/21 (phase36)
-   [x] pnpm run build — zero TypeScript errors

-   [x] Express static middleware serves uploads at /uploads/avatars/<filename>
-   [x] Public avatar URL (protocol + host + path) persisted to avatar column via updateProfileById
-   [x] authenticate middleware applied — Bearer token required
-   [x] multer added as backend dependency; AVATARS_DIR created at startup via fs.mkdirSync

-   [x] ProfileAvatar widget — circular avatar with gold-gradient ring; falls back to player initials
-   [x] ProfileInfoTile widget — icon + label + value row used inside the profile info card
-   [x] ProfileStatusBadge widget — colour-coded pill: green (active), amber (suspended), red (banned)
-   [x] EditProfileSheet — modal bottom sheet; edits fullName / country / avatar via ProfileService.updateProfile; calls onSuccess(UserProfile) to update the parent screen without a second network round-trip
-   [x] ChangePasswordSheet — modal bottom sheet; calls ChangePasswordService.changePassword; maps WrongCurrentPasswordException to inline field error (sheet stays open, session preserved)
-   [x] ProfileScreen — stateful screen: loading / error / data states; RefreshIndicator; AnimatedSwitcher; Edit Profile and Change Password action buttons with widget keys for testability
-   [x] 10 widget tests (mobile/test/features/profile/profile_screen_test.dart) using fake service subclasses — no platform-channel timing dependencies

## Phase 5.6 - Forfeit & Game Termination

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-19)

-   [x] `backend/src/socket/game_lobby.ts` — `handleForfeit(socket, io, data)`:
    verifies participant, guards on `in_progress` status, queries opponent via
    `match_players`, sets `matches.status = 'finished'`, `winner_id`, `finished_at`,
    emits `game_over { matchId, winnerId, reason }` to room;
    `finishMatchByForfeit(io, matchId, forfeitingUserId, reason)` shared helper
    used by both explicit forfeit and auto-forfeit; `activeGameBySocketId` Map
    (socketId → matchId) populated by `handleGameStart` after `game_start`;
    `handleDisconnectForLobby` extended — checks `activeGameBySocketId` on
    disconnect and calls `finishMatchByForfeit` with reason `'disconnect'`
-   [x] `forfeit` Socket.IO event registered in `setupGameLobbyHandlers`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/game/models/game_over.dart` — `GameOver(matchId,
    winnerId, reason)` with `fromJson`, `==`, `hashCode`, `toString`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/services/game_lobby_service.dart` —
    `onGameOver` broadcast `Stream<GameOver>` added; `forfeit(matchId)` method
    emits `forfeit` socket event; `_handleGameOver` handler; `game_over` handler
    registered in `joinRoom`, removed in `leaveRoom`/`dispose`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/game/screens/game_screen.dart` — upgraded to
    `StatefulWidget`; subscribes to `onGameOver` in `initState`; forfeit button
    calls `service.forfeit(matchId)` and shows loading spinner (`_forfeiting`
    state); `_GameOverOverlay` widget shown when `_gameOver != null`; overlay
    has title (YOU WIN / YOU LOSE), subtitle (forfeit / disconnect reason), and
    CONTINUE button that fires `onGameOver(GameOver)` callback; `gameLobbyService`
    required constructor parameter; `onForfeit` callback replaced by service
    injection; keys: `game_over_overlay`, `game_over_card`, `game_over_title`,
    `game_over_subtitle`, `game_over_continue_button`, `forfeit_spinner`,
    `forfeit_label`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/navigation/main_shell.dart` — `_onGameStart` passes
    `gameLobbyService` and `onGameOver: _onGameOver`; `_onGameOver(GameOver)`
    calls `Navigator.popUntil((r) => r.isFirst)`
-   [x] `backend/tests/phase56_forfeit.mjs` — 5 integration tests:
    forfeit emits game_over to both sockets, missing matchId → error,
    non-participant → error, double-forfeit idempotent, disconnect → auto-forfeit
-   [x] `mobile/test/features/game/game_screen_test.dart` — 25 tests (updated):
    smoke, AppBar, first-turn banner, match info, placeholder board, forfeit
    emits event, spinner, button disabled while forfeiting, overlay absent before
    game over, overlay appears on game_over, card/title/subtitle/continue present,
    CONTINUE fires onGameOver with correct payload, overlay disables forfeit button
-   [x] `mobile/test/features/matchmaking/game_lobby_service_test.dart` —
    extended: `game_over` handler registered in `joinRoom`; onGameOver stream
    emits `GameOver` for forfeit and disconnect reason; malformed payload dropped;
    `forfeit` emits socket event; safe before `joinRoom`; `leaveRoom`/`dispose`
    clean up `game_over` handler and stream
-   [x] `mobile/test/navigation/main_shell_test.dart` — extended: GameScreen
    now receives `gameLobbyService`; `_onGameOver` pops stack to root after
    CONTINUE tap
-   [x] Backend build — clean (esbuild, no TypeScript errors) ✅
-   [x] Flutter SDK not available in Replit environment — flutter analyze and
    flutter test deferred to local/CI environment ⚠️

## Phase 5.2 - Flutter Matchmaking Service Layer

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-19)

-   [x] `SocketClient` (`mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/services/socket_client.dart`) — thin injectable wrapper around socket_io_client; JWT fetched via injected tokenProvider; `SocketConnectionException` for connection errors; all methods non-final for test subclassing
-   [x] `MatchmakingService` (`mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/services/matchmaking_service.dart`) — `joinQueue()`, `leaveQueue()`, `getQueueStatus()`, `onMatchFound` broadcast stream; maps `SocketConnectionException('unauthorized')` → `SessionExpiredException`
-   [x] `MatchFound`, `Opponent`, `QueueStatus` models with `fromJson`
-   [x] `MatchmakingException` typed exception (non-session matchmaking errors)
-   [x] 29 unit tests in `mobile/test/features/matchmaking/`
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 217/217 passed (188 prior + 29 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 5.4 - Flutter Game Lobby

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-19)

-   [x] `backend/src/socket/game_lobby.ts` — `setupGameLobbyHandlers(io)`; `join_room` handler: verifies match participant, joins Socket.IO room, tracks in-memory readiness, emits `room_joined` on entry and `room_ready` to both players when count ≥ 2; `leave_room` handler: emits `room_left` + `opponent_left`; disconnect cleanup; `roomJoinedSockets` Map cleared automatically
-   [x] `backend/src/socket/index.ts` — `setupGameLobbyHandlers(io)` wired after matchmaking handlers
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/models/room_ready.dart` — `RoomReady(matchId)` model with `fromJson`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/services/game_lobby_service.dart` — `GameLobbyService(socketClient)`; `joinRoom(matchId)`: throws `SessionExpiredException` if disconnected, registers `room_ready`/`opponent_left` handlers, emits `join_room`; `leaveRoom(matchId)`: emits `leave_room`, clears handlers, disconnects socket; `onRoomReady` broadcast stream; `onOpponentLeft` broadcast stream; `GameLobbyException` typed exception
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/screens/game_lobby_screen.dart` — `GameLobbyScreen(gameLobbyService, matchFound, onSessionExpired, onLeaveRoom)`; 5 states via `AnimatedSwitcher` 280 ms: joining (spinner), waiting (opponent card + leave button), ready (check icon + match info + disabled start button), opponentLeft (amber banner + leave button), error (red banner + leave button); `joinRoom` called in `initState`; `leaveRoom` called in `dispose`; `_MatchInfoCard`, `_LobbyAvatar`, `_LobbyColorChip`, `_LeaveButton` private widgets; all interactive keys present
-   [x] `mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/screens/matchmaking_screen.dart` — `onMatchReady(MatchFound)` callback added; PLAY button calls `_reset()` then `widget.onMatchReady(match)` instead of `_reset()` only
-   [x] `mobile/lib/navigation/main_shell.dart` — `gameLobbyService: GameLobbyService` required parameter; `_onMatchReady(MatchFound)` handler pushes `GameLobbyScreen` via `Navigator.push`; `MatchmakingScreen` receives `onMatchReady: _onMatchReady`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/navigation/auth_gate.dart` — `gameLobbyService: GameLobbyService` threaded from `OneLudoApp` → `AuthGate` → `MainShell`
-   [x] `mobile/lib/main.dart` — `GameLobbyService(socketClient: socketClient)` constructed and injected; `OneLudoApp` gains `gameLobbyService` required parameter
-   [x] Constructor DI only — no singletons, no static references
-   [x] No new pubspec dependencies added
-   [x] Backend build clean (esbuild, no TypeScript errors)
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 269/269 passed (234 prior + 35 new, zero regressions) ✅

## Phase 5.3 - Flutter Matchmaking UI

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-19)

-   [x] `MatchmakingScreen` (`mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/screens/matchmaking_screen.dart`) — replaces `HomeScreen` placeholder in `MainShell`; four states (idle / searching / matchFound / error) via `AnimatedSwitcher` 280 ms; subscribed to `onMatchFound` stream in `initState`; elapsed timer (MM:SS) shown during search; `leaveQueue()` fire-and-forget in `dispose`; all interactive keys present (`find_match_button`, `cancel_button`, `searching_text`, `elapsed_time`, `match_found_text`, `opponent_name`, `match_color`, `room_code`, `play_button`, `error_banner`, `retry_button`)
-   [x] `SessionExpiredException` during `joinQueue` routes directly to `onSessionExpired` callback → `MainShell.onLogout`
-   [x] `_OpponentAvatar` — circular avatar with initials fallback
-   [x] `_ColorChip` — colour pill for the assigned Ludo colour
-   [x] `main.dart` updated — `SocketClient` + `MatchmakingService` constructed and injected; `OneLudoApp` and `AuthGate` updated with `matchmakingService` parameter
-   [x] `auth_gate.dart` updated — threads `matchmakingService` from `OneLudoApp` → `AuthGate` → `MainShell`
-   [x] `main_shell.dart` updated — swaps `HomeScreen()` for `MatchmakingScreen(matchmakingService, onSessionExpired: onLogout)`; `HomeScreen` file preserved (existing tests unaffected)
-   [x] 15 new widget tests (`mobile/test/features/matchmaking/matchmaking_screen_test.dart`): smoke, idle keys, searching state, elapsed timer, cancel → idle, leaveQueue called on cancel, match_found → match found state, opponent name, room code, color chip, play → idle, session expiry callback, error banner, retry → idle
-   [x] `main_shell_test.dart`, `auth_gate_test.dart`, `widget_test.dart` updated — `_FakeMatchmakingService` + `_FakeSocketClient` added; pump helpers updated; test 3 (`main_shell_test`) now asserts `MatchmakingScreen` instead of `HomeScreen`
-   [x] Constructor DI only — no singletons, no static references
-   [x] Material 3 dark/gold palette consistent with all screens
-   [x] No new pubspec dependencies
-   [x] flutter analyze — no issues ✅
-   [x] flutter test — 234/234 passed (217 prior + 15 new + 2 fixes, zero regressions) ✅
-   [x] Docs updated: 02_PROJECT_STATUS.md, 09_CHANGELOG.md

## Phase 5.1 - Matchmaking Backend Foundation

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-18)

-   [x] Migration 0007: matches table (id UUID PK, room_code UNIQUE, mode CHECK, status CHECK, entry_points, player_count, winner_id FK, started_at, finished_at, created_at; indexes on status, room_code, created_at)
-   [x] Migration 0008: match_players table (id UUID PK, match_id FK CASCADE, user_id FK CASCADE, color CHECK, final_rank, earned_points, joined_at; UNIQUE on match_id+user_id, UNIQUE on match_id+color; indexes on match_id, user_id)
-   [x] matchmaking.queue.ts — in-memory Map queue (enqueue, dequeue, getEntry, isQueued, queueSize, dequeueOpponent, removeStaleEntries); race-condition safe due to Node.js single-thread guarantees + synchronous dequeue before any await
-   [x] match.service.ts — createMatch() atomic PostgreSQL transaction (collision-free room code generation, random color assignment, match + two match_players rows); findMatchById()
-   [x] matchmaking.controller.ts — GET /match/queue/status (read-only; queue join/leave is Socket.IO-only)
-   [x] routes/matchmaking.ts — GET /match/queue/status behind authenticate middleware
-   [x] socket/matchmaking.ts — JWT auth middleware (verifyAccessToken + findById, attaches socket.data.user); find_match handler (atomic dequeue-then-pair or enqueue-and-wait); leave_queue handler (idempotent); disconnect cleanup (guards on socketId to avoid evicting reconnected player)
-   [x] socket/index.ts — setupMatchmakingHandlers(io) wired in
-   [x] routes/index.ts — matchmakingRouter mounted
-   [x] index.ts — queue stale-entry cleanup interval (5 min, .unref())
-   [x] socket.io-client added as devDependency for integration testing
-   [x] 10/10 REST integration tests (backend/tests/phase51_matchmaking.sh)
-   [x] 31/31 Socket.IO integration tests (backend/tests/phase51_matchmaking_socket.mjs): unauthorized connection, authenticated connection, find_match → queue_joined, leave_queue (idempotent), two-player pairing → match_found (payload fields, shared matchId/roomCode, different colors), duplicate find_match (idempotent reconnect), disconnect removes player from queue
-   [x] Zero regressions: 35/35 (phase31) + 25/25 (phase33) + 21/21 (phase36) + 31/31 (phase41) + 50/50 (phase44)
-   [x] Backend build clean (esbuild, no TypeScript errors)
-   [x] Docs updated: 06_API.md, 07_SOCKET_EVENTS.md, 02_PROJECT_STATUS.md, 09_CHANGELOG.md

## Phase 5.5 - Game Session Initiation

Status: ✅ Completed (2026-07-19)

-   [x] Backend `game_lobby.ts` — `handleGameStart` scheduled 2.5 s after `room_ready`: reads both player colours from `match_players`, randomly selects `firstTurn`, updates `matches SET status = 'in_progress', started_at = NOW()`, emits `game_start { matchId, firstTurn }` to the Socket.IO room
-   [x] `GameStarted` model — `mobile/lib/features/matchmaking/models/game_started.dart`; `const` constructor; `fromJson`
-   [x] `GameScreen` placeholder — `mobile/lib/features/game/screens/game_screen.dart`; stateless; first-turn banner, match info card, placeholder board, forfeit button; no Navigator calls; constructor DI only
-   [x] `GameLobbyService` — `onGameStart` broadcast stream added; `_handleGameStart` registered/cleared in `joinRoom`, `leaveRoom`, `dispose`
-   [x] `GameLobbyScreen` — `onGameStart(GameStarted, MatchFound)` callback added; `_gameStartedSub` subscription
-   [x] `MainShell` — `_onGameStart` method pushes `GameScreen` via `MaterialPageRoute`; forfeit calls `popUntil(isFirst)`
-   [x] `game_screen_test.dart` — smoke, AppBar, first-turn banner, forfeit button, placeholder board, match info card
-   [x] `game_lobby_service_test.dart` — extended with `onGameStart` stream tests
-   [x] `game_lobby_screen_test.dart` — extended with `game_start` → `GameScreen` navigation test
-   [x] `main_shell_test.dart` — extended: simulating `game_start` from lobby pushes `GameScreen`
-   [x] Backend build clean (esbuild, no TypeScript errors)
-   [x] Docs updated: 07_SOCKET_EVENTS.md, 02_PROJECT_STATUS.md, 09_CHANGELOG.md, 12_ROADMAP.md
